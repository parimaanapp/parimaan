# Parimaan — E2E MVP Implementation Plan

**Version:** 2.0 — LOCKED (all 15 open questions resolved; supersedes v1.0 and TIP v0.1)
**Owner:** Amogh Kulkarni
**Timeline:** 6 months, ~10 hrs/week, ~260 hrs total, solo dev
**Design system:** Parimaan — Haldi & Terracotta (30 components, tokens locked)
**Wireframes:** 49 mobile screens across 12 flows (v2)

**Phase 0 execution status (as of 2026-08-14):** AWS dev + prod accounts created and linked under one AWS Organization (both auto-upgraded to Paid Plan on linking — expected, see PRD §17.2a). Sole proprietorship registration **in progress**, not yet confirmed (blocks task: apply for AWS Activate credits, Q11). Domain `parimaan.app` bought; `.in` and `.com` **still pending**. Social handles `@parimaanapp` (Instagram, X) and `parimaanapp@gmail.com` secured. AWS Activate **not yet applied for**. Monorepo scaffold (Sprint 0) in progress — see `docs/DEV_WORKFLOW.md` §5. Homebrew + Flutter installation blocked on user's admin credentials (cannot be automated non-interactively); `mobile/` exists as a placeholder pending `flutter create`.

## 1. Requirements restatement

Parimaan is a household-shared meal planning, pantry, and shopping-list app for Indian kitchens, delivered as a Flutter mobile app (iOS + Android) with a light Next.js web dashboard, backed by an AWS serverless stack in `ap-south-1`. The MVP anchors on one core loop — plan the week, subtract pantry, generate a shopping list, share as image, mark items bought, deduct pantry when a recipe is marked made — and layers four narrow AI features on top: photo pantry helper, cook-from-pantry, freeform recipe parse, and staples check note. It ships with a hand-authored 50-recipe curated library (30 North + 20 South Indian), Google SSO only, household-scoped data with a 5-member cap, and push notifications.

Success is defined as: (a) the founder's own household using it daily by end of month 3, (b) 3+ external beta households using it weekly by end of month 6, (c) sync latency <5s across household members, and (d) AI acceptance rates hitting product-quality targets in PRD §11 (photo pantry ≥70%, freeform parse ≥80%, URL import ≥80%). Explicit non-goals: cart integrations, i18n, offline write, per-role permissions, ingredient normalization, nutrition tracking, subscription billing.

## 5. Dependencies

### External accounts (open in W0 unless noted)

| Dependency | When | Blocking? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWS dev account | W0 | Yes | MFA + IAM admin user |
| AWS prod account | W0 | No, but do it | Under Organizations from day 1 |
| AWS Activate application ($1,000) | W0 | No | Submit ASAP; approval 1–2 wks; covers ~4–5 yrs at beta scale |
| Google Cloud OAuth client | W0 | Yes for W1 | Decide which Google account owns it (see Open Q) |
| Firebase project (FCM) | W0 or W19 | Yes for W20 | Free |
| PostHog account | W22 | No | Free tier; **decide EU vs US region — India residency implication** |
| Apple Developer | W0 (submit) | Yes for W20 | ~1 wk to enroll; use `parimaan@` alias, not personal |
| Google Play Developer | W0 | Yes for W20 | $25 one-time, instant |
| Namecheap (`parimaan.app` + `.in` + `.com`) | W0 | No | ~$25/yr; brand protection |
| GitHub (private repos) | W0 | Yes | Branch protection on `main` |

### Internal / build-time dependencies

- **Design system → Flutter theme translation** (W1). Blocking for all UI work. Deliverable: `lib/shared/ui/theme.dart` + component library reaching feature-parity with the 30 CSS components by W8.
- **Phosphor Regular icon font** bundled in Flutter assets (W1).
- **Fonts:** Instrument Serif, DM Sans, JetBrains Mono, Noto Serif Devanagari — licensed check + embedded in `assets/fonts/` (W1).
- **Curated recipe authoring (WS-9)** is a 2-week content block in W13–W14 — must be scheduled as writing time, not code time. Founder authors + one round of edits.
- **JSON-LD Recipe schema coverage on Indian blogs** must clear the W7 spike or the URL import UX changes (fallback to freeform paste).
- **Bedrock model availability in ap-south-1** must clear the W7 spike or the AI-features Lambdas need cross-region config from day one.
- **Aurora auto-pause behavior** must clear the W3 spike or the plan swaps to on-demand `db.t4g.small` (~$27/mo flat).

## 6. Risks

Original 6 spikes from TIP §9, plus 4 new spikes surfaced by the design system + wireframes context.

| # | Risk | Category | Mitigation | Scheduled spike / checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Bedrock Claude unavailable in `ap-south-1` | Technical | Cross-region fallback to `us-east-1`; accept +150–250ms latency | **W7** (day 1) |
| R2 | JSON-LD Recipe schema coverage < 60% on Indian blogs | Technical | Copy-paste fallback UX in URL import screen; downgrade importance | **W7** (target ≥16/20) |
| R3 | AppSync subscription with 5 concurrent clients drops events | Technical | Reduce to per-entity subscriptions; add refetch-on-reconnect | **W11** (30-min soak, 5 clients) |
| R4 | Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause resume >30s | Technical | Disable auto-pause (+$35/mo) or switch to `db.t4g.small` | **W3** (15-min idle, first-query timing) |
| R5 | Bedrock vision accuracy <60% on Indian pantry | Technical | Restrict feature to labeled/packaged items OR cut from MVP scaffold kept | **W17** (20 real photos) |
| R6 | RDS Proxy connection exhaustion under Lambda concurrency | Technical | Data API fallback; batch resolvers | **W11** (20 concurrent Lambdas) |
| R7 | **Flutter perf with 280-recipe library (50 curated + user + curated seed × N)** | Technical (new) | Paginated list; `flutter_lazy_indexed_stack`; recycled item widgets; benchmark on low-end Android | **W6 spike:** benchmark 300-item list scroll on a Redmi-class device |
| R8 | **Image compression pipeline (client) drops quality unpredictably** | Technical (new) | Fix to `image` package pipeline; benchmark on 30 photos; server rejects >500KB | **W17** as part of vision spike |
| R9 | **Offline read-cache invalidation causes stale display after 24h absence** | Technical (new) | Cache-first + background refetch; invalidate per-household on foreground; TTL 24h | **W23 spike:** stale-then-refresh testing |
| R10 | **Design system font licensing (Noto Serif Devanagari / Instrument Serif)** | Legal | Confirm SIL Open Font License; embed with attribution in About screen | **W1** (30-min check) |
| R11 | 5-member cap frustrates joint families | Product | Onboarding flag; v1.1 raises cap; document | Ongoing beta feedback |
| R12 | Users compare unfavorably vs AnyList/Paprika polish | Product | Beta invite copy sets expectations; focus DoD on core-loop excellence | W24 beta framing |
| R13 | Household-level pricing sets low revenue ceiling | Business | Post-MVP: cap AI features in free tier | Post-MVP (v1.1) |
| R14 | AI costs blow past $5/day alarm at beta | Business | CloudWatch alarm at $5/day; per-user daily rate limits; Haiku for text | Continuous from W17 |
| R16 | **No E2E test strategy existed in any locked doc** (surfaced during `DEV_WORKFLOW.md` planning — the SD §7.3 citation this plan was drafted against turned out not to exist) | Technical (new, 2026-08-14) | Proposed and adopted: Detox (mobile, 3 flows) + Playwright (web, 1 flow), introduced at **W16** (not month-4 start) since the core loop only stabilizes at W12 and W13–14 are content weeks. Run nightly + pre-release, not per-PR. Written after each flow is manually verified working, not TDD-first (selector churn against an unbuilt UI produces no design pressure). | **W16** (`e2e-runner` owns authoring + CI wiring) |
| R15 | Solo dev burnout at 10 hr/wk × 26 wk | Delivery | Slide the plan; take full weeks off; don't compress | Ongoing — check monthly |

## 7. Complexity + effort estimates

Total budget: **~260 hrs** (10 hr/wk × 26 wk).

| Phase | Weeks | Hours | Complexity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 (Prereq) | W0 | ~8 | L | Account setup, no code |
| Phase 1 (Foundation) | W1–W4 | ~40 | **H** | CDK + Cognito + Flutter theme + 17 screens; **stretch** — Flutter learning curve slows this ~30% |
| Phase 2 (Core Data + Sync) | W5–W8 | ~40 | M-H | Two AI spikes in W7, subscription reliability |
| Phase 3 (Core Loop) | W9–W12 | ~40 | **H** | Rotation logic + shopping list generation + pantry deduction; most business logic here; **stretch** if W7 spikes require rework |
| Phase 4 (Content + Web + Share) | W13–W16 | ~40 | M | W13–W14 content-heavy not code-heavy; Web dashboard is smaller than mobile |
| Phase 5 (AI + Push) | W17–W20 | ~40 | M-H | Vision spike could invalidate photo pantry; push notifications iOS is fiddly |
| Phase 6 (Polish + Beta) | W21–W24 | ~40 | M | Feedback-driven; scope tight |
| Buffer | W25–W26 | ~20 | L | Absorbs slippage — **assume at least one phase spills into buffer** |

**Stretch phases flagged:** Phase 1 (Flutter learning), Phase 3 (business logic depth), Phase 5 (vision accuracy risk). If any one of these overruns by 2+ weeks, the plan slides — do NOT compress the next phase.

### MVP overall DoD (must hit all)

- **Functional:** all MVP scope in PRD §7.1 shipped; all 4 AI features in §7.2 shipped with confirm-before-write.
- **Performance:** 2-device sync latency <5s at P95; app cold-start <3s on mid-tier Android; photo upload success >95%.
- **Quality metrics:** photo pantry ≥70% acceptance; freeform parse ≥80% acceptance with ≤3 edits; URL import ≥80% success on top-20 blogs.
- **Coverage:** Lambda domain-logic tests ≥80%; Flutter state-layer tests **≥80%** (amended 2026-08-14 — see §0 note below); CDK snapshot tests present.

> **§0 amendment (2026-08-14, filed during Sprint 0):** the Flutter coverage target above was raised from the original ≥60% to ≥80% to match `DEV_WORKFLOW.md`'s locked decision #3 (full strict TDD everywhere — chosen explicitly over the lighter backend-only option). This is a real tradeoff against the tight 260-hour budget, tracked via the Phase 1/W4 checkpoint in `DEV_WORKFLOW.md` §6a. See `DEV_WORKFLOW.md` §0 for the full amendment rationale and §3.3 for how the ≥80% target is kept affordable (push logic out of widgets into domain/state layers; golden tests only on the 30 shared design-system components, not per-screen).
- **Ops:** 5 CloudWatch alarms armed; PostHog funnel live; cost tracker shows <$35/mo.
- **Distribution:** 3+ external beta households on TestFlight + Play internal.
- **Docs:** PRD, System Design, this plan, and a `RUNBOOK.md` for incident response, all in `docs/`.

## 9. Explicit non-goals for MVP

| Out of scope | Target version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Household roles beyond primary/member (viewer, admin) | v1.1 | Trust model in MVP: all members full-edit |
| Primary-user transfer | v1.1 | Protects future subscription owner; "delete household" as escape hatch (open Q #4 lean: yes) |
| Ingredient normalization (canonical `ingredients` table + aliases) | v1.1 | Substring match good enough for MVP allergen warnings |
| Receipt OCR (AWS Textract) | v1.1 | Photo pantry covers the batch-entry job |
| Full AI recipe generator (open-ended) | v1.1 | Cook-from-pantry is the constrained version |
| Web parity with mobile (meal plan editing) | v1.1 | Read-only + recipes + settings only in MVP web |
| iOS/Android home-screen widgets | v1.1 | Post-beta polish |
| Cooking mode (step-by-step, screen-on) | v1.1 | Not core to Sunday-planning loop |
| Barcode scan for packaged items | v1.1 | Photo pantry covers this |
| Subscription billing (Stripe/Razorpay) | v1.1 | MVP is free; data model already carries `subscription_status` etc. |
| Nutrition macros | v1.2 | Indian nutrition DB is bottleneck |
| Meal-plan templates ("festival week") | v1.2 | Rotation covers steady state |
| Recipe scaling (double, halve) | v1.2 | Manual override on servings works |
| Min-required slot rules (must-have 1 carb) | v1.2 | MAX caps are enough |
| Multi-language UI (Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Kannada) | v1.2 | Design string layer with `intl` from day 1; ship strings post-MVP |
| Cross-household recipe sharing / deep links | v1.2 | Household-shared covers the primary need |
| Offline write-and-sync | v1.1 | Read-cache only in MVP (cheapest to build) |
| Social feed / discovery | Never (unless proven) | Explicitly anti-goal |
| Restaurant / dine-out logging | Never | Anti-goal |
| Diet coaching, weight-loss features | Never | Anti-goal |
| Full nutrition tracking with goals | Never | Anti-goal |
| Direct cart integrations (Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, Zepto, Amazon Fresh) | Never (until public APIs exist) | No public APIs; share-as-image is the compromise |

## 10. Locked decisions (formerly open questions)

All 15 decisions below are final. This plan is locked and ready for W0 to begin.

| # | Question | **Locked decision** | Detail / rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | RDS Proxy vs. Data API vs. direct connection? | **Direct connections first, no RDS Proxy upfront.** | W3 and W11 spikes test 20–30 concurrent Lambda invocations against real Aurora `max_connections` (roughly 90 at 0.5 ACU, up to ~300–350 at 2 ACU — approximate, verify against actual metrics). Direct connections don't degrade gracefully to "slow" — they cliff into hard connection-refused errors past the limit. At beta scale (20 users) sustained load is very unlikely to hit that ceiling; the real risk is a burst (push notification triggering many simultaneous subscription reconnects). Add RDS Proxy (+~$18/mo) only if the spike shows failures — don't pay for it speculatively. |
| Q2 | Amplify auth library on Flutter — yes/no? | **`amplify_auth_cognito` only; everything else hand-rolled.** | Hand-rolling OAuth PKCE + redirect handling + token refresh in Flutter is a realistic 1–2 week detour (redirect URI handling differs between iOS/Android, token refresh races, secure storage integration). Amplify's auth-only usage costs ~2–4MB bundle size (~8–15% of an estimated 20–30MB baseline app — not decision-driving) and some risk of lagging new Xcode/iOS releases. Fallback: `flutter_appauth` (thin wrapper over native AppAuth libraries) if Amplify's lag risk ever actually bites. |
| Q3 | Prod AWS account — provision W0 or later? | **Both accounts (dev + prod) provisioned in W0**, under one AWS Organization. Reconsidered twice (single-account-with-Lightsail and single-account-with-IAM-boundaries were both evaluated and rejected) before relocking here. | Direct AWS cost of 2 accounts vs 1 is **$0** either way — cost is driven by resource usage, not account count. Account-level separation was chosen over single-account + IAM permission boundaries because: (a) **service quotas are account-level and shared** within one account — Lambda concurrency, Bedrock RPM, AppSync throttle limits — so a dev-side load test or bug could starve prod's headroom; two accounts give independent quota pools; (b) IAM boundary policies are a *policy* boundary that can have bugs, vs. an account boundary which is structural and can't be misconfigured into a breach; (c) billing separation is unambiguous by construction, no tagging discipline required. **Lightsail was considered and rejected** as a way to "separate" dev/prod — it's a simplified VPS product that doesn't host any of our actual services (AppSync, Lambda, Aurora Serverless, Cognito, Bedrock, DynamoDB are all managed services independent of any VM); using it would mean abandoning the serverless architecture in System Design v0.1, not separating it. **Sequencing gotcha (verified):** AWS Free Tier is pooled/aggregated across an Organization, not doubled per account — no free-tier advantage to 2 accounts. Separately, promotional/free-tier credits that land on an account *before* it joins an Organization have been reported to expire immediately, with no warning, upon joining. Mitigation: **form the AWS Organization immediately after creating both accounts, before either account accrues any credit**, then apply for AWS Activate afterward — Activate credits are confirmed to apply correctly to the consolidated bill and can be shared across linked accounts via billing preferences once the Org exists first. |
| Q4 | Which Google account owns the OAuth client? | **New dedicated `parimaan@` Gmail/Workspace account**, not personal. | Decouples production auth infrastructure from personal Google identity lifecycle; cleaner for eventual OAuth consent-screen verification. |
| Q5 | PostHog region — EU vs US? | **EU Cloud** (`eu.i.posthog.com`), with a **DPA requested at account creation** (W22). | EU Cloud data sits in AWS `eu-central-1` (Germany) — verified via PostHog's own subprocessors page. Not an India-residency guarantee (no India region exists among mainstream product-analytics SaaS), and cross-region transfers rely on SCCs, not a hard EU-only guarantee. DPA must be actively requested, not automatic from region choice. **Self-hosting PostHog in `ap-south-1`** is deferred to v1.1+, only if India's DPDP Act rules (still being finalized) require in-country storage — self-hosting adds real ops surface (ClickHouse/Kafka/Postgres/Redis) not worth taking on speculatively. |
| Q6 | i18n string layer from day 1 — yes/no? | **Yes.** `flutter_intl`/ARB files scaffolded in W2; English-only strings shipped for MVP. | Retrofitting i18n later means finding and extracting hardcoded strings across all 49 screens — expensive, mechanical, low near-term value. Cheap to route all copy through a lookup layer from the first screen built. **Exception: the wordmark (परिमाण, Noto Serif Devanagari) stays hardcoded** — it's brand, not translatable UI copy. |
| Q7 | Amplify Hosting vs. Vercel for web dashboard? | **Amplify Hosting.** | Keeps the entire deployment story inside one AWS account / one CDK pipeline. Also cheaper in practice: Vercel's free Hobby tier contractually forbids commercial use (confirmed via Vercel ToS) — since Parimaan is explicitly heading toward monetization, Vercel would require Pro at $20/seat/month from day one. Amplify Hosting's free tier (1,000 build-min/mo, 5GB storage, 15GB transfer, 500K SSR requests/mo) comfortably covers the 4-screen MVP web dashboard; beyond that, costs stay in the $0–1/mo range already modeled in System Design §17.2. |
| Q8 | Curated library seeding — copy-per-household or shared table? | **Copy rows on `createHousehold`.** | 50 recipes × modest household counts keeps storage cost trivial at MVP/beta scale. Copying avoids an entire class of shared-mutable-state bugs, since favoriting/rotation-toggling/editing curated recipes are all explicit per-household MVP features. |
| Q9 | Beta testers for the core-loop milestone (W12)? | **Friends with low-stakes tolerance for bugs**, not necessarily immediate family. | Real multi-person usage is the actual point (shared pantry/plan/list sync bugs only surface with genuine concurrent use) — solo dry-runs test the wrong thing. Low-stakes testers reduce the cost of a mid-week failure during an admittedly unfinished app. |
| Q10 | "Delete household" escape hatch when primary user must leave? | **Ship in MVP.** Confirmation requires **typing the exact household name** before the delete executes. | The DB schema already supports cascading deletes via existing FK constraints (System Design §7.1) — implementation cost is roughly half a day. Without this, a primary user who must exit has zero way out, which is a dead-end, not just a rough edge. High-friction confirmation matches the destructive, irreversible-for-all-members nature of the action. |
| Q11 | Legal entity for AWS Activate — required? | **Register the sole proprietorship in W0** (~₹3,000–8,000 total: GST + Udyam are free on official portals, Shops & Establishment license ₹2,500–5,000, optional professional service fees ₹1,000–5,000; ~7–10 working days), then apply for AWS Activate once registration confirmation is in hand. | Research showed AWS Activate likely doesn't strictly require a registered entity (a company website + LinkedIn presence may suffice as "verifiable existence"), but given the low cost and short timeline, registering removes any ambiguity and also unlocks GST-registered business banking needed for Razorpay/Stripe billing in v1.1. |
| Q12 | Design system → Flutter theme: hand-port or codegen? | **Hand-port** the ~60–70 CSS token constants (colors, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, motion) into `theme.dart` in W1. | The token set is small and, being locked, won't change repeatedly — codegen would be effort spent solving a problem that doesn't recur. **Drift-check convention:** a `docs/design-tokens-snapshot.json` is created alongside the W1 hand-port; any future session touching `theme.dart` or the design system diffs against that snapshot first and flags drift before proceeding. (This is a trigger-on-touch check, not a standing background monitor — acceptable since the design system is meant to be locked going forward.) |
| Q13 | Melos vs. plain pnpm for repo tooling? | **pnpm workspaces** for `api`/`web`/`shared`/`infra`; **Flutter (`mobile/`) stays a standalone peer directory**, invoked with plain `flutter` CLI commands. | Melos solves multi-package Dart/Flutter monorepo coordination — Parimaan's mobile side is a single Flutter app, so there's nothing for Melos to coordinate. |
| Q14 | Where to ask notification permission in onboarding? | **Contextual — immediately after the first shopping list is generated**, not during onboarding/sign-in. | Asking for permission before any value has been demonstrated yields lower opt-in than asking right after a concrete moment where the benefit is obvious (list changes, meal reminders only matter once a plan/list exists). **Wireframe deviation:** Flow 1 currently draws a "Notifications prompt" screen during onboarding — this must NOT be built in that position. Instead, insert the prompt into Flow 6 at the "Generate list · preview" screen (end of W11). |
| Q15 | Font licensing — SIL OFL confirmed? | **Confirmed.** All four fonts (Instrument Serif, DM Sans, JetBrains Mono, Noto Serif Devanagari) are licensed under **SIL Open Font License 1.1** — free for commercial use, embeddable, no royalties. JetBrains Mono's only restriction (can't call a modified version "JetBrains" without permission) is irrelevant since the font isn't being modified. No attribution is legally required, though an "About Parimaan" credits mention is still good practice. |

**PLAN LOCKED — v2.0.** All 15 decisions above are final. W0 (Prerequisites) can begin immediately: register the sole proprietorship, open both AWS accounts under one Organization, create the `parimaan@` Google account, buy domains, and apply for AWS Activate once entity registration confirms. `TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` v0.1 is superseded by this document and should be treated as historical reference only.
